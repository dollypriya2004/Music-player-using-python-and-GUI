# Music-player-using-python-and-GUI

The Python Music Player with a Simple GUI project is designed to offer users a straightforward yet effective music playback experience. Developed using Python and the Tkinter library for creating a user-friendly graphical interface, the application allows users to add songs to a playlist, control playback with play, pause, and stop buttons, and seamlessly navigate between tracks using next and previous buttons. The GUI displays essential song information, including title, artist, and duration, creating a visually engaging experience. The project also incorporates volume control, a progress bar for visualizing song position, and basic playlist management features such as removing songs. With its modular structure, the main script initializes the GUI and event handlers, while separate modules manage audio playback, playlist functionality, and GUI creation. This project serves as a solid foundation for a simple music player, providing room for future enhancements like shuffle and repeat functionality, equalizer integration, and customizable themes. The end result is a user-friendly music player that strikes a balance between simplicity and functionality.
